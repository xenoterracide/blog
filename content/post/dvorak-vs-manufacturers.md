The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Dvorak</a> Keyboard is supposedly better than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwerty">qwerty</a> keyboard.<br /><br />Theoritically all you have to do is change the keyboard layout in your OS and then pop the keys off your keyboard and re-arrange them (technically the second step isn't required but nicer). However all the keyboards I've seen attache the F and the J differently (they also have the home row bumps). Why do they attach them differently? why does it matter to them? is that really needed? I know it isn't anything functional. Do they really have an interest in keeping us from swithching?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
