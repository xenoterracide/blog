first I hate repositories, but it is unlikely they will go away. So we must strive to make sure that they are only needed for truly rare things. from my perspective the sunrise repo shouldn't exist. and vcs builds  should be in the tree. regen2 should strive to have everything possible in the tree. when it can't an overlay should have all the capabilities of the main tree. meaning that an overlay shouldn't automagically be considered less stable and require the keywording of all the ebuilds in it. also overlay's should be search-able regardless of whether they are installed to expedite the finding of apps.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
