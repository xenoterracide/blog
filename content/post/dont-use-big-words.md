> Next time, in promulgating your esoteric cogitations, or articulating your superficial sentimentalities and amicable,
philosophical or psychological observations, beware of platitudinous ponderosity. Let your conversational
communications possess a clarified conciseness, a compacted comprehensibleness, coalescent consistency, and a
concatenated cogency. Eschew all conglomerations of flatulent garrulity, jejune babblement, and asinine affectations.

> Let your extemporaneous descantings and unpremeditated expatiations have intelligibility and veracious vivacity,
without rodomontade or thrasonical bombast. Sedulously avoid all polysyllabic profundity, pompous prolixity,
psittaceous vacuity ventriloquial verbosity, and vaniloquent vapidity. Shun double-entendres, prurient jocosity, and
pestiferous profanity, obscurant or apparent!!

> ** ** In other words, talk plainly, briefly, naturally, sensibly, truthfully, purely. Keep from slang; don't put on
airs; say what you mean; mean what you say. And, don't use big words!

I don't know where this came from originally, but I should also say... cut the technical jargon to a minimum. Not
everyone knows everything you do and even if they know all the words laymans terms may be a better way of explaining
it. Give an analogy, if they don't get it; Reduce it to the simplest possible terms.
