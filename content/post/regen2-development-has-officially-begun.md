That's right I'm putting my money where my mouth is. It's small but the first 2 packages when into the <a href="http://github.com/xenoterracide/portage/tree/regen2">regen2 tree</a> this morning. They are MySQL 5.1.30 which was added because the gentoo maintainer refused to add it do to instability. I agree that it is unstable, but we have ~M Hard Masked packages for that reason. It has been added as ~M. The other app added is qsynergy, the ebuild was already on portage and I know it to be good so I added it to the tree, I'll probably stabilize it in a few weeks.<br /><br />Since Regen2 is a fork of <a href="http://funtoo.org">Funtoo</a> you can enjoy all the benefits of Funtoo's changes in my tree, and I will try to get mine accepted into Funtoo.<br /><br />In the future I will be building stable Regen2 tarballs, although only stage3's.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
