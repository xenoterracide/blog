I was going to write something up about what's wrong with open source developers. But Beranger beat me to it by explaining why <a href="http://www.beranger.org/edito2008/index.php">Open Source is not about love</a>.<br /><br />I agree with him on everything except what he says about kde (and even that's not wrong kde4 just isn't ready to be judged yet).<br /><br />I have one thing to say in addition to it though.<br /><br />There are 4 kinds of open source developers<br /><br />1.) The insulting arrogant loud mouth<br />2.) The developer that doesn't develop and is never heard from<br />3.) The developer that develops and says not all of us are like #1 and #2 (but is otherwise quite)<br />4.) The developer that speaks up, helps with fixing user problems (whether just telling you how. or writing a patch) and is polite about it. Sometimes they won't fix your problem now, but hey, programming does take time, and there are priorities.<br /><br />#4 is the only good one of the bunch.<br /><br />I admit that sometimes I am more like #1 than I should be. But we can't all be Buddha all of the time.<br /><br />Those of you not striving to be like #4 are part of the problem. I don't want to use your project.  Even if I could fix your project I wouldn't, because I have more important things to do, and better people to help.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
