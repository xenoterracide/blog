First, I enjoyed [this movie][imdb]. I'd give it a B grade as far as movies go. However, it can't possibly survive it's
own hype. The CGI in the movie is awesome. The story is so, so. Historically it's wildly inaccurate, but you should have
known that from the trailer. I won't be buying this one, nore probably watching it again. However, I think it is worth
seeing at least once, and probably on the big screen just for the graphics.
