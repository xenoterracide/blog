<a href="http://sayperl.org/">SayPerl</a> launched yesterday. It's essentially aggregated perl blogs translated through google's translation service into english. Very awesome. 3 things could make it better.<br /><br />1) An atom/rss feed <br />2) instead of clicking on 'spanish' and listing all the feeds that were written in spanish... click on spanish (or make it espanol) and have it show all the feeds translated into spanish.<br />3) It's newest post is a while ago... so it's update speed could be a bit better.<br /><br />But all in all very good, I like. Fix #1 and I'll switch my perl feeds to it.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
