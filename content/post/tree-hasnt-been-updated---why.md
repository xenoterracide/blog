So 2 days ago, when I went to sync to gentoo I didn't get any updates. I'm not really sure why as the process seemed to go alright. It could have something to do with the next bit.<br /><br />My System appeared to have been compromised. Syslog-ng was disabled and all logs post dec 30 2008 were removed. So i've spent the better part of yesterday/today reinstalling my system. Tree should be synced and merged tonight.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
