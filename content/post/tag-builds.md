This is just a feature concept. May or may not ever happen. Live builds for portage usually run off the trunk/master branch of a scm tool. This is a great idea, but why couldn't we take this a step further, usually people who use scm's 'tag' there releases, so why couldn't the same 'live' build have an option for using a tag instead of trunk. This would allow releases to roll out much faster too. The downside of this is hard drive space for keeping repository checkouts.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
