although there isn't much to say about it, it's even more limited than the original vi. If you are like me and have been using a vi clone for so long that other editor's are unimaginable. I suggest trying <code>busybox vi</code> on your *nix cli. At least until you can install vi(m).<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
