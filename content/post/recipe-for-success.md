<strong>Example 1</strong><br /><br /><blockquote><p>In 2003, an Internet meme known as "How You Remind Me of Someday", or "Nickelback to Back", was created to illustrate the similarities between the songs "How You Remind Me" and "Someday".</p><p>In response, bass player Mike Kroeger said "I think that's remarkable for someone to notice that there is a hit quality. If all hits sound the same, then sorry. When you are a band that has a distinct style such as us or AC/DC, that happens. When you have a distinct style, you run the risk of sounding similar."</p></blockquote><em> --<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickelback">Wikipedia (NickelBack)</a></em><br /><br /><strong>Example 2</strong><br /><a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1813453">Batman vs The Dark Knight Trailer</a><br /><br />So the Question is? is there actually a recipe for success?<br /><br />is there a difference between short term, medium term, and long term success? How is it that the Parthenon is greater than the Empire State Building (or even the tallest building currently being constructed) Why has Beethoven and Mozart survived the Centuries but Michael Jackson (Prince of Pop) couldn't survive the decades.<br /><br />Could we analyze and find formula's for success perhaps there are more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">Golden Ratio</a>'s.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
