At Baker College they don't allow teachers to grade based on attendance. I'm sure this policy is common with most schools. So what do the teacher's do? they grade based on participation. This is crap as to be able to participate you must attend the class. What the teacher's are actually doing is re-labeling attendance points as participation. Because it doesn't matter whether you take part in a class conversation. All you have to do is show up.<br /><br />I'm sorry but I feel this is wrong. I've had to miss one class twice due to bad weather. I refuse to drive what is normally a 45 Minute drive in white out conditions with a layer of snow on the road. My instructor is going to let me make up more than 1 quiz (the school only allows 1 normally) and I emailed my homework, but I'm still screwed out of attendance points, I mean 'participation' points.<br /><br />Just so everyone knows, I'm going to a university in the fall.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
