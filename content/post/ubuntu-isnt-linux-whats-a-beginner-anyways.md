Today Joel Spolsky <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/fork-it/">announced The results</a> of <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/should-unix-linux-and-ubuntu-be-merged-vote/">the poll</a> of whether <a href="http://ubuntu.stackexchange.com/">ubuntu SE</a> and <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/">unix SE</a> would be merged, they won't. In short the Unix community was in favor of it but the Ubuntu community was not. Joel had this to say: <blockquote>So, Ubuntu, Linux, I get it, it’s clearly not the same thing. If you love Ubuntu, we have a site for you. If you love Linux and Unix, we have a site for you. A Stack Exchange can’t work without a community that loves a subject, and love is very… specific. Fighting human nature is hard: the factionalism and fork-happiness of the Unix world has been a hallmark of that community ever since BSD vs. System V, and Stack Exchange can no more bridge that gap than we can unite the Judean resistance.</blockquote><br />I am horribly disappointed in this decision, this factionalism doesn't help the cause, this set's precedence that it's ok in the StackExchange community to be a separatist. Arch Linux's bash must not be the same as Ubuntu's or Fedora's, and of course they've made so many changes to upstream Gnome as to be unrecognizable as such.<br /><br />The main argument in favor of this separatist movement is that Ubuntu is for beginners, if that's so then why isn't it beginner.unix SE? What's a beginner anyways?<br /><br />I'd dare wager that 99.999% (POOMA) of all Linux users are windows Power users, veterans, and refugees. So what's a beginner? someone that doesn't know what Firefox is? No they probably do. Maybe they don't know where it is in the menu? I can see that... but I don't see how that can't be answered with a Screenshot and a Ubuntu tag on Unix SE. Maybe it's someone who doesn't know how to use the CLI? Well where do you define beginner from advanced? I realize someone reading there first shell programming Tut/Book/etc is a beginner, but are they no longer a beginner after that? how do you know you're not a beginner anymore? When you choose to move beyond Ubuntu? If I've been using Linux for 5 years and I choose to move to FreeBSD am I a Beginner?<br /><br />Why is that the answer to a beginner from an advanced user isn't welcome? Is it good that beginner are exclusively answering other beginner questions?<br /><br />In other news it looks like I may become a moderator ( temporary at least ) for unix SE.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
