When I forked Regen2 from Funtoo over a year ago I created a web page for it on sites.google.com. The hosting and uptime were both right for what I needed. The dns has long expired but I went to sites today to find a public link to the content, only to find that at some point they upgraded sites and completely trashed all the content I had put on there. Sure they have a revision control on there now... but it doesn't contain ANY of the content I had left. WTF Google? I'm sure someone is going to say 'backups' but honestly, I killed the project, whatever was there wasn't really important to me anymore. But I didn't expect that it would get trashed in some Google update.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
