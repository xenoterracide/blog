I don't mind when people offer additional advice. But when a question about package Y is asked don't suggest package X (unless you have to say not possible in Y but it is in X). I mean when I ask how do I fix this dependency blocker in portage don't suggest paludis. The blocker would still exist.<br /><br />If I ask which files are my config files so I can migrate them. don't say move all of your files. Answer the question asked.<br /><br />If you want to answer it with a link fine. Just make sure the link is specific (e.g. if I ask a question don't point me to the docs without citing a specific section. chance are I looked there).<br /><br />If you don't know, it's ok to say you don't know.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
