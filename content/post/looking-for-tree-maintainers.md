I'd like to see multiple people merging the tree, with best case scenario being that it happens more than once a day. worst case status quo. I'm willing to write the scripts and teach anyone how to do it. I just ask that you can read an ebuild (to some degree) and have good judgement, or at least not too embarrassed to ask. Most ebuild merges are IUSE, KEYWORDS, and cvs line. the rest is really almost automated, merge (del package.mask) merge (fix ebuilds), repoman manifest, gen_metadata, commit, push. This will allow me to focus on other things hopefully, and make the distro better quality.<br /><br />email the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/regen2-dev">dev list</a> if you're interested.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
