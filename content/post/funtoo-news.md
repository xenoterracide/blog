I've decided I'm going to start posting a sort of weekly newsletter (I'm not committing to weekly though) merely to document anything I feel important that happened, or is about to, but isn't quite important enough for it's own post.<br /><br /><a href="http://ra.fnord.at/">RA</a> (ra-- on #funtoo) or <a href="mailto:r_a@lavabit.com">r_a@lavabit.com</a> submitted quite a few patches this week including 1 that fixes many of my major borkage on non-latin1 changelog breaks. He's become a regular contributor and I'd like to thank him.<br /><br />perl-5.10 will be unmasked this evening, if you haven't read it yet, read my <a href="http://xenoterracide.blogspot.com/2009/01/funtoo-gets-new-perl.html">post</a> on upgrading, you'll need it, because this is more than just an install and forget, other packages need to be rebuilt, and perl-cleaner revdep-rebuild doesn't find them all. Good news is I've been running 5.10 since the beginning of the month no problems since the beginning.<br /><br />I pushed samba 3.2.7 into the tree this week, gentoo's been sitting on it for a while, it's hard masked, but seems to build fine, I don't operate on a windows network though so can't say how well it works.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
