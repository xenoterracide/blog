A lot of people think I'm a  $explicative (insert your favorite one there). I've [said][tddd] some things that I
shouldn't have because I was pissed at the Person(s) at the moment. I would like to formally apologize to RJBS for 
the negative things that I said, about him. He's been nothing but kind to me and is a great contributor to the perl
community (and maybe others?). I greatly disrespected RJBS and I actually do regret it. I should have posted this 
weeks ago when I realized I shouldn't have said it.

I hope that RJBS will accept my apology.

I would however hope that RJBS or any other member of the perl community would not take exception to my contributions
even though I can be an $explicitive.
