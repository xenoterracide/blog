As of right now <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Software-License/lib/Software/License.pm">Software::License</a> has no way to combine licenses on the fly. To be honest this deficiency might not be a bug in SL, it could be in <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Pod-Weaver/lib/Pod/Weaver.pm">Pod::Weaver</a> or <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Dist-Zilla/lib/Dist/Zilla.pm">Dist::Zilla</a> this is a know deficiency and RJBS plans on fixing it at some point. In the mean time we can implement dual licenses (and multi-licenses) in much the same way the Perl5 license is implemented.<br /><br />I was probably in legal violation (I am not a lawyer) with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template-ShowStartStop/lib/Template/ShowStartStop.pm">Template::ShowStartStop</a> version 0.05 and 0.06 because I used Perl_5 licensing because that's the closest I could get with Dist::Zilla, due to the limitation. So I created <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Software-License-GPL3andArtistic2/lib/Software/License/GPL3andArtistic2.pm">Software::License::GPL3andArtistic2</a> which is sort of a perl5 license, except that it mandates the latest version of GPL and Artistic (at the time of this writing). Version 0.07 of Template::ShowStartStop is back in compliance with the licensing of the code I forked from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template-Timer/Timer.pm">Template::Timer</a>.<br /><br />This hasn't, and will probably not be merged into Software::License because it's just a stopgap measure until multi-license support can be implemented.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />this is apparently not necessary according to Duncan and the <a href="http://www.theperlreview.com/Interviews/allison-randal-artistic-license.html">this interview</a> I've updated the module to reflect this. Hopefully, it can serve as an educational source.<br /><br />Curious... why doesn't Perl5 switch to the Artistic 2.0 then... (I wonder what that would mean for 'under the same terms as perl5' but actually including gpl1 and artistic 1).<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
