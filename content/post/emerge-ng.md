at the time of this writing. a concept for software with a name that may not be it's final, and it may never get done.<br /><br />emerge-ng should ultimately be a drop in replacement for the portage package (the main package manager) in <a href="http://gentoo.org">gentoo linux</a>.<br /><br />for clarity I will be referring to portage as the software and if I mean to refer to portage's tree (basically one giant software repository), I will refer to it that way.<br /><br />I know of at least 3 other projects to replace the outdated barely maintainable portage. I think all of them are going about it wrong. They are developing different package manager's instead of developing a better version of emerge. They are right that portage needs to be rebuilt from ground up, but that doesn't mean that the interface the user sees is bad. if vim had not tried to be mostly a clone of vi would it have been as successful?  so successful that is it more popular than what it cloned? if gnu coreutils weren't posix compliant and didn't mostly match the original unix commands would we be using them? probably not.<br /><br />I will be writing posts here to detail features that emerge-ng can benefit from.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
