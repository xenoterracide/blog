So I think that <a target="_blank"  href="http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Programming-Learners-Language/dp/0596802374?ie=UTF8&tag=xenotsblog-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969">Head First Programming: A Learner&#39;s Guide to Programming Using the Python Language</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=xenotsblog-20&l=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969&o=1&a=0596802374" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important; padding: 0px !important" /> is a great guideline to teach any programming course, esp a 10 week course as it has 10 chapters. We're one week behind. Arguably you could merge week 2 into week 1 and I may do just that in a rewrite of this series. In fact I'd suggest you do just that. But for now I'm going to continue on and we'll see what people think once I reach the end. No reason I can't rewrite this series, especially since it's not really planned I'm just writing it on the fly.<br /><br />Although this book is a good guideline (note: I'm also concerned that if I follow it's examples to the letter all the time I might violate fair use), chapter 2 annoys me, it's on textual data and uses html scraping as an example. However, it completely ignores html parsers and any other sane way of doing it. So I had to find a better example and I think I have with parsing PKGBUILD's, which are sort of a microformat bash script.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
