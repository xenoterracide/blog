I think that Google's (not Blogger's) OpenID is a failure. It's not memorable and you can't find it. I've been trying to figure out where google has my OpenID listed for 30 minutes now. This is not the first time I've had to do this. I usually use Blogger's because it uses my blog's url, but it's currently error-ing with a typepad blog. Why can't google use something like google.com/username ? something we could remember. Why isn't it listed in an obvious place in my account details? Why is it when I search "google openid" it talks about the announcements all over the place, but never how to find out what your url is.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Found it on <a href="http://lenni.info/blog/2009/12/whats-my-google-openid-url/">lenni.info</a><br /><br />UPDATE:<br />it's this <code>https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id</code><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
