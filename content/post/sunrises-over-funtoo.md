<a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/sunrise/">Sunrise</a> a <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/userguide.xml">overlay</a> is being added to <a href="http://funtoo.org/">Funtoo</a>. So if you've got layman tracking sunrise and you're using funtoo you'll be able to delete sunrise from your overlays as I'll be merging sunrise's reviewed ebuilds daily.<br /><br />The hardest part of the whole process was merging package.mask, use.local.desc and categories. Since this is new be on the lookout for bugs or problems.<br /><br />Want to add an overlay to funtoo yourself? First, it'll have to  be a git or svn overlay. If it's git you can skip steps involving git svn.<br /><br /><code>git svn clone uri://mysvnuri.tld</code><br /><br />this imports an entire svn repository into git and will take a while, sunrise had import over 7000 commits. Next check to see if any changes need to be made to the structure of the overlay, in sunrise's case it's not branched properly... they had a subdirectory structure including reviewed and non-reviewed ebuilds, I had to remove that so the top level directory was that of a portdir for merging. if it's already in a nice portdir format move to the next step.<br /><br />start by cd-ing into your funtoo portdir checkout, then run <code>git pull uri://mygit-svn-cloned-repo</code>, this will attempt to merge the 2 and most likely you will have conflicts. Resolve ebuild, and changelog conflicts first, these are easiest with git mergetool, imho, but don't try to use that to merge manifests. Instead of merging manifests just regenerate them with ebuild ebuildWithScrewedManifest digest. once you've resolved all conflicts run <code>git commit</code>. That's it your done. you've now merged an overlay into your local funtoo tree. If you'd like to see it in funtoo you'll have to talk to Dan Robbins. He's on #funtoo on freenode regularly.<br /><br />Enjoy!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
