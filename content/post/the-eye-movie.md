<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0406759/">imdb entry</a><br /><br />I went to see this the other night. Because <a href="http://ncgmovies.com">NCG</a> was having problem's with Cloverfield... and we were already there.<br /><br />I didn't find it scary at all. A little creepy. The blurry vision and screaming death shadows were just annoying.<br /><br />I did think that it might be an interesting concept for a Mage Awakening in <a href="http://www.white-wolf.com/mage/index.php">Mage the Awakening RPG</a>. Not as is of course.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
