Perl 5.12 has been languishing in the testing repo for a while, there are now several packages that have been rebuilt in testing and community testing. All of the rebuilds I reported have been fixed. If you use arch please make sure you're using their rebuilt packages (and not one you rebuilt because it took like 2 months to do this) if you have any problems file a bug. If you aren't sure which package is really the problem feel free to drop me a line and I'll see if I can help you tack it down. I have over 200 cpan packages on my box right now all of which successfully pass their test suites.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
