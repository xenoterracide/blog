I'm sure you've read about Debian's OpenSSL blunder. If not here's a recap on [Linux.com][linuxcom].

I'm just wondering... is it possible that the pain will be so great for admins that the great stable debian will be
discontinued from production server use? I would (but I don't use debian based systems for anything but livecds),
seriously this is a hugely idiotic mistake, the pain of which is only [beginning][register]. This may in fact be the
biggest security blunder I have ever heard of in open source.
