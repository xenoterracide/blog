So advent is 24 days of high quality tutorials, and it's great, and ++ too all the people who make articles. But I've
got a problem... it never shows up in my feed that I read in Feedly (formerly read in Google reader). This is
compounded by the fact that there are many advents, each with there own yearly feed... so each year I have to
poke around at the various projects to see if they're doing advent, and if so to subscribe to the feed. The solution...
we just have the advents aggregated by [ironman][ironman] This is a really cheap hack, but would allow the advents
that are being created a greater distribution than it is probably now getting. We could also just patch the various
advent sofwares to provide a feed that continues eternally year after year, instead of a new feed each year which seems
not so useful, and make sure we provide that link instead of the "just this year" link, in the UI. I suppose I could go
fix it... but at this time I'm not sure where the source code for advent is, nor whether each advent has it's own
software backing it, [Perl 6 is using Wordpress][p6] which doesn't have this problem. I suppose I could add the ones I
find to ironman but maybe the advent creator's don't do that for a reason, so I'd rather not step on toes.
