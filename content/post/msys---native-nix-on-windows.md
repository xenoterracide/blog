<a href="http://www.mingw.org/msys.shtml">msys home</a><br /><br />This is not a virtual machine, not an emulator, and technically not linux. This is a native linux like environment on windows, including BASH, the coreutils, vim and more. Brought to you by the wonderful people who brought us mingw. If you are a *nix person and HAVE to use windows I highly suggest you install this. With this Firefox, Opera, Pidgin, and many more cross platform apps you will start to feel to home in windows.<br /><br />EDIT: You can get git for it here. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/">msysgit</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
