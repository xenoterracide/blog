as I've been saying here recently I'm burned out, on so many angles it's not funny. I'm apathetic, I'm not really sure
I care anymore. I'm actually playing with arch at the moment to see if it's a better fit. I also here debian sid might
work. I don't want to maintain the tree 7 days a week anymore, and I'd like an up to date system.

I've been talking with Daniel Robbins lately about the possibility of a common tree with Funtoo, I'm not sure he wants
to do it the same way I do, which is unfortunate. doing this might take the load off me that I don't want, but it's
entirely possible that it's too late for it to matter.

I'm going to take a few days and see what happens, it's entirely possible that I'm just going to give up at this point.
I'll let people know in a few days what I've decided.
