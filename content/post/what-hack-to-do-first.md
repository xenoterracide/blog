Lets see, I could work on the ipset init script bug (meaning write the init script) for gentoo. I could start digging into amarok 2's sql.I have to figure out my Linksys WRT54GL and whether I want openwrt or ddwrt or just to leave it as is. I could be hacking my web app, or regen2. So many choices, so little time.<br /><br />I don't really feel like doing the router now. So that's out. Sometime this week though.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
