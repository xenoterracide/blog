So after a little post about Regen2 on the Gentoo-dev mailing list. I've been offered mentoring to become an official gentoo dev. I'm conflicted, my main reason for saying yes would be to learn stuff that I can't learn on my own. But I'm not sure I really want to be a gentoo-dev this means doing these other time consuming things, and I wouldn't be able to do nearly enough from the inside. I still have to proceed with regen2... as I don't believe gentoo (in spirit) can be saved from within. So should I work to become an offical gentoo dev?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
