<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489099/">IMDB entry</a>)<br /><br />Saw this movie yesterday. It was Ok. It wasn't great, it wasn't horrible. I can't really say anything, good about it. But I can't say anything bad either. I enjoyed it, I won't be buying it, or seeing it again though.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
