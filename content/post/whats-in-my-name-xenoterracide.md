So 2 days in a row I've had developers discussing the root of my handle.

so here we go.

[xeno][xeno] is greek, normal definitions aside in science fiction it is often used when referring to
alien life forms.

[terra][terra] is latin, it means earth.

is english (with latin roots), means killer or killing.

loosely translated it meant to me 'alien earthling killer', but that was when I was 16. Now, it's just my handle and
has no other meaning to me other than it's unique and a part of my history.

yes I'm aware that I mixed language roots, and I know some of you have a problem with that. To those that do, it's just
a name, get a life.
