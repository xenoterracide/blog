All of this MFA for every single site is getting on my nerves. I won't say stronger passwords are just as good, but they almost are.

Guys, seriously, unless you're super critical like email, password managers, WebHost accounts, banks, or health records.
(not that those latter two seem to do this). Just require stronger passwords and make MFA optional.
Better yet, stop doing password storage and just use Single Sign-On through OIDC providers, like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, or Twitter.

Fourteen character passwords should be the minimum nowadays. What if people can't remember those? Provide a list of password managers they can use.
Also, emails and text messages? Stop sending codes; just make it a link, gods. If you can reset a password with a link,
you can send me a login link after I verify my credentials.

I hate dealing with this every time my browser upgrades, or insert other reason it thinks my browser is new,
and browsers do that all the time these days.
