Just before my abrupt departure from my former employer, I took over maintaintership of&nbsp;<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Pod::Spell">Pod::Spell</a>. I have started working to clean up the code, add modern and more tests, and improve the wordlist. There is much to be done on this front. More tests are needed yet, to ensure no accidental breakage. There's possibly a unicode bug lurking within Pod::Spell. More words are needed for the wordlist. Patches are welcome as I don't have all the time in the world to work on it.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
