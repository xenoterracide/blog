I haven't forgotten about it. I seem to lack all motivation on Spring Break. Nothing to procrastinate on. Now that school has started I'm working in full swing, I've been learning metro the past few days. I should have the tarballs ready by the end of the week. I'm not sure on mirrors right now. Have at least one volunteer mirror, and I will be torrent-ing them. I've been seriously procrastinating on finding out how to get on the Uni mirror ring.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
