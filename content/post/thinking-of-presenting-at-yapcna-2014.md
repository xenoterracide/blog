So I'm thinking of proposing some talks for YAPC::NA Orlando, and/or maybe do some training. Here's my thought on what
I could do that would be a contribution and different from other talks. For Training it might just be a combination of
all of the concepts I could do as individual talks. Basically the idea is "I've learned Perl and Moo[se], now how do I
build a large application".

* UML
* SOLID Object Oriented Design
* Design Patterns
* Domain Driven Design
* Patterns of Application Architecture
* Service Oriented Architectures, REST, ROA, RPC (including RESTful RPC and Resource Oriented RPC), and Pub/Sub
* ORM Patterns ( Active Record / Data Mapper / Transaction Script )
* MVC
* Layered Architecture
* Ports and Adapters
* Dependency Injection ( with Bread::Board )

Let me know your thoughts.
