Unfortunately the developers of this project are the kind that I don't want to deal with. Their documentation is below average, and the average documentation is already sad. Instead of plugging in to msys, they  require you to use their fork of msys. I call it a fork because it isn't a 1:1 copy, they add and removing things as they see fit. Their primary installer doesn't include msys.bat (apparently other installers do) this makes launching the msys bash environment easy. They don't explain why you should pick one installer over another. I asked how I should add the git programs to an existing msys install and never got an answer. I complained that git didn't work with the msys vim-7.1 port, ultimately the response I got was git is a developer tool and as a developer I should be able to help myself, and I was ruining there fun coding (I'm sorry even if I am a developer what makes your think I have time to fix YOUR project and MINE.<br /><br />I'm sorry that they don't want to support their product, make it better, or work with the parent projects (msys)<br /><br />On their site it says that eventually they are planned to become an officially supported git method. I hope this isn't true, as user support will be horrible.<br /><br />This unfortunately means I can't use msys as part of the reason I was going to use it was for git. I will have to switch to cygwin instead.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
