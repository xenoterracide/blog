This is an attempt to apply a [Maturity Model](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MaturityModel.html) to Programming Languages. This model attempts to be paradigm agnostic, there may be other models which could be used to determine how Functional a language that supports functional programming is for example.

* Level 0 - Conditional Execution and Variables
* Level 1 - Turing Completeness, Iteration and Named Procedures
* Level 2 - Module Encapsulation
* Level 3 - Library Formats and Build tools
* Level 4 - Library Repositories
* Level 5 - Standard Libraries
