We need a page linked from Perl.org that says 'Get Hosted' (or something like that). The page will have a list of the top 10 Perl friendly web hosts on it. The top 10 will be determined by people with CPAN ID's voting it up or down (the use of CPAN ID's should prevent spammers from gaming the system like digg get's gamed). It could have in the listing, rank, # of positive votes, business name, site uri, technologies supported (e.g. cgi, fastcgi, mod_perl, plack, etc), and maybe starting price. Of course you should have a link to the complete list. Companies should be able to register themselves without getting a CPAN ID.

Just an idea for making it easier to find great Perl hosting.
