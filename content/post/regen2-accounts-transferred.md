<a href="http://www.xenoterracide.com/2009/05/regen2-dont-care-anymore.html">I killed regen2 about 2 years ago</a>. Today I was contacted by Rafal Kupiec asking about the project. Since it's dead he asked if he could take over the project. I have transfered the github account, and freenode channel #regen2 to him. The google groups are remaining archived. At some point in the future there should be a site at <a href="http://www.asiotec.org/">asiotec.org</a> I have no idea what he plans on doing with it.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
