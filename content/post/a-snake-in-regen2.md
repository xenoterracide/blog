I'm sure you're thinking I'm talking about me ;) nope first order of business, add more stuff which should be in gentoo.

I'm pleased to announce that I've added py3k also know as Python 3.0 to Regen2. It will remain hardmasked as unmasking could create stability issues on a gentoo based system given it's reliance on python.
