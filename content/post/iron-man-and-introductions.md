So I've decided to "compete" in the <a href="http://www.enlightenedperl.org/ironman.html">Iron Man competition</a>.<br /><br />My name is Caleb Cushing, I'm a 25 year old, unemployed, student, living in the Greater Lansing, MI, USA, area. I've been programming perl for approximately 6 months. This includes a lot of off time, time to relearn the language from the class I took a couple years ago (and learn modern perl), learning Catalyst and DBIC, all of which is an ongoing process. I would guess I've been writing useful code for about 4 months and even that is a slow going process as I've still got a lot to learn.<br /><br />Previously, I was the tree maintainer for Funtoo, and tried spinning my own fork of Funtoo/Gentoo, it needed more devs than me to survive though. I now use <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>. After an arch/perl user who went by aCiD2 moved to OS X I adopted most of his perl AUR (arch user repository) packages in addition to ones I had created myself. I now have <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?SeB=m&K=xenoterracide">over 200 CPAN packages on AUR</a> in Arch's PKGBUILD format.<br /><br />I'm a contributer to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Catalyst-Manual/">Catalyst::Manual</a> and I created <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template-ShowStartStop/">Template::ShowStartStop</a> by forking <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template-Timer/">Template::Timer</a>.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll become more active as time goes on, and have more interesting posts than this one.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
