<a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.devel/55315">details are here</a><br /><br />so apparently the folks running the kde overlay have decided to discontinue portage compatibility. I suppose I can't blame them, on the other hand I don't approve. Even though I haven't started testing paludis yet. I am still firmly against it as it is as gentoo's next package manager. I won't be regen2's without heavy modification. Including some re-writes. I do intend to investigate the possibility of using paludis code in emerge-ng.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
