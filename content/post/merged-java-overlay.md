Java in Gentoo is horribly out of date, and from what I've seen of the java overlay, it doesn't improve the situation much, but it's still better than without it. I've merged it into regen2.org, since this was I think the most painful merge since the first I ever did, I may have made mistakes on some ebuilds, let me know if you experience problems.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
