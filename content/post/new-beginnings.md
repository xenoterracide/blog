Since I *truly* last posted a lot has changed. I moved to Houston, TX, USA (from MI) for a position as a Linux System
Administrator. As of this week I've been moved to the programming department in my company, coding Perl. I'm also an
elected moderator on [StackExchange's Unix & Linux][unixse]. Of course there's always updates to [my CPAN dists][xeno].
