You've been taught how to write a resumé, or curriculum vitae, wrong. Recently we've been looking to replace a member 
of our team. So we've read a lot of resumés and I've realized that we're teaching people how to write them wrong.

First and foremost, when teaching people; write in groups. Have everyone write  a fake resumé for a given
job. Now put those resumés in a pile and redistribute them to another group, and ask people to filter out the
candidates they want to call. Now make notes for why you aren't calling the other candidates and give them to those
people. Keep iterating until everyone has had a chance to review other resumés. I truly believe that only by actually
doing the work of filtering resumé's can you learn why they're broken.

## Page count

Don't have more than 3 pages, probably don't have more than 2 (see keywords optional last page). If you have 5 pages
that or mostly copy and paste, that's a negative.

## Your name

This is more of an opinion, and probably my weakest argument. When going through the stack of resumés I'm looking at
your name the least, and in fact I've realized that prominent display can only hurt you. If I have any racial, gender,
age, etc, biases, your name is a dead give away. I'm going to experiment with this, but I'm going to start putting
my name small in the footer of my resume.

## Your skills

Firstly, I skim these, I consider any skill list to be keywords for a search engine. Since it's simply keywords I'm
considering making it an optional last page. However, you should still be able to talk about it since it's on your
resume.

That said, I search them looking for spelling errors. If you write PERL on your resume when the `perlfaq`  says it's
`Perl` or `perl`, that's automatic negative points for not correctly spelling the technology you're using, I assume you
don't know it that well at that point. I'll probably ignore a non caps typo, if it happens once, for example I just
saw a resume that said "Postgress", and once would have been a typo, but it was in their ~4 times. By the way,
recruitors, when you send me job requirements that mispell technologies that's an automatic failure.
